# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz



This course's homework was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write with a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

I chose to do an Office theme quiz with animated images and interactive interface. 
Unfortunately due to time I could nto get the timer to decrease 20pts nor add up the score to add up into the Dundes Honor List. 
Hoping to continue to work on this and finish it in the future for my portafolio.
